# tidy data course project
This documents an approach for analyzing human activity recognition using smartphone data.  It is in response to the course project in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Coursera/Johns Hopkins University.

Codebook:

Xtrain: tmp variable, representes X_train.txt
Xtest: tmp variable, represents X_test.txt
X: X dataset, combined test and train data
Ytrain: tmp variable, represents Y_train.txt
Ytest: tmp variable, represents T_test.txt
Y: Y dataset, combined test and train data
Strain: tmp variable, represents S_train.txt
Stest: tmp variable, represents S_test.txt
S: S dataset, combined test and train data
features: tmp variable, represents features.txt
mean_and_std_indeces: variable to track the indeces of the mean and standard deviation measurements.
activities: a holder variable for named activities
labeled: a combined data set of S, X, and Y data
uniqueSub: represents unique value of the S data set
numSub: represents the length of uniqueSub
numAct: represents the length of the activities variable
numCol: the length of the labled variable
final: the final cleaned, merged, labeled, tidy data set.
row: a row-counting variable
n: a counting variable for traversing the matrix
